## Awesome Lorem Ipsum

This is some pointless text that is just a space-filler. It is indeed just a space-filler because if you read this you will not get any information. The informationlessness of this text is paramount to its existence because that makes it a text without information. You should not be reading this text because it will give you no information. After reading this text you will have learned nothing, not even that this text contains no information because you could have known that just from the first sentence of this text. So, I sincerely hope that you didn't read this far. This is truly and completely an informationless text that you're reading and, more likely than not, not reading! But if you are reading this text, you have wasted quite a lot of your time.

## My First Experience Forking

So, to be frank, I think forks are the least useful of the three types of cutlery. I would say that spoons are the most useful, at least if you're only allowed to choose a single cutlery hand implement. As in, you can't do much with only a knife. But a knife is super important too because you can't cut anything without a knife. I would only consider using a fork if I already had a spoon and a knife. I still think that chopsticks trump the rest.
